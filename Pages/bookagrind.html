          <p class="center">Hi, I am EÃ³ghan ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>I am a 21 year old Physics Student, who has been tutoring for a year now. I started tutoring and giving grinds as I really wanted to help people of all levels in Maths and Science to realise their potential and improve.</p>
          <p>I am a very patient person who is organised and motivated. I have a strong sense of adaptability, allowing me to tailor my teaching approach to suit the unique needs and learning styles of each student.</p>
          <p class="bottompara">My goal is to gear my students towards being the best that they can be and help them achieve their goal, whatever it may be, in their respective exams.</p>

          <li class="bold">The First Grind with Me is Completely Free!</li>
          <li>Lessons are individually tailored towards the unique needs of each student.</li>
          <li>In the lessons the student and I will look over each individual topic on the curriculum in detail, or go over a certain topic in which the student wants to be covered or is struggling with.</li>
          <li>If the student is weak in certain areas, these will be identified and we will work towards improving these areas. Helping them achieve their goals, improve their understanding if the topic and improve their grades.</li>
          <li>Come the end of the year when exams are coming thick and fast, the lessons' focus will move primarily towards exam questions and techniques.</li>
          <li>If you decide to take up Grinds with me I will be available for contact 24/7 by WhatsApp if you need any help with a problem or are stuck with homework.</li>
          <li>By the end of my lessons I hope that you will have improved your knowledge of Maths or Physics, how to approach exam questions and will have improved your overall grades.</li>
