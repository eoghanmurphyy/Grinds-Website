            <p>
              Eóghan has been so helpful in helping my Hannah to achieve better
              grades in Maths. Hannah has gone from failing maths to getting an
              honour in less than 6 weeks. Eóghan is very patient and makes
              maths a lot easier for Hannah to understand. Thanks Eóghan.

              Eóghan is a very dedicated, patient and adaptable tutor. He has
              greatly improved my results and understanding in various Maths
              topics already. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking
              to accelerate their learning for the Leaving Cert.

              I find that Eóghan explains the Maths questions with more detail
              and time rather than a school teacher who speeds along without
              making sure you know how to do the sum properly. He also goes at
              the speed you want to go and so this makes learning and doing the
              sums 10 times easier. I will continue to use Eóghan for grinds as
              he knows his formulas and how to teach them. Thank you Eóghan for
              all your help.

              Eóghan was a brilliant tutor, he made a plan for me at the start for certain topics and we succeeded with that plan.
              He also helped me with my confidence in maths and made me solve most of the questions myself.
              He is a truly gifted teacher and I found his methods to work very well.

              Eóghan was a great teacher who helped me greatly in HL maths. In the space of a month I went from badly failing, to a h5 standard. He was very clear when explaining everything and extremely helpful.
